"Day 1 - They came for the offline-first, but they stayed for the performance ","There's a big push for offline-first development, with a new buzzword — ""Progressive Web App"", or PWA — making the rounds for the last year or two. But a lot of what's being said sounds like the coding equivalent of ""eat your vegetables!"" What's in it for ME? Quite a bit, it turns out. In this talk, Jason will share the surprising ways online apps will see huge benefits when they're built to support offline users. Learn how to ace the Lighthouse test with just a few simple changes and how you can easily create offline-first apps with just a few lines of code; also how going offline-first will improve the connected experience, including better performance, increased stability and reliability, improved user experience, and more! So, in addition to eating your vegetables — you know, making your web apps usable for people with slow and unreliable connections or whatever — you'll ALSO see your apps get even better for connected users. And all with minimal development effort required.","Wed, 30 Aug 2017 09:30:00 +0200","Wed, 30 Aug 2017 12:45:00 +0200",45.0731163,13.6371103,https://github.com/shoutem/wsc2017/blob/master/assets/images/workshop.png?raw=true,day1-pwa

Day 1 - Universal JS web applications with React ,"Since we started seeing JS on the server side, the developers' dream has been to reduce the gap and the cost of switch between frontend and backend. Today with Node.js, React, and a whole ecosystem of tools, this dream is becoming true! In this workshop, Luciano is going to discuss Universal (a.k.a. Isomorphic) JS and present some practical examples regarding the major patterns related to routing, data retrieval, and rendering. He will use Node, React, webpack, Babel, and React Router, and give you a series of examples to get you started easily with this new technology trend.","Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:45:00 +0200","Wed, 30 Aug 2017 17:00:00 +0200",45.0731163,13.6371103,https://github.com/shoutem/wsc2017/blob/master/assets/images/workshop.png?raw=true,day1-react

Day 2 - Supercharged React Native development with Shoutem,"React Native is an awesome technology for building native mobile apps. However, creating an app still remains a cumbersome task. Did we reach the maximum of development efficiency? Shoutem designed an architecture to eliminate all the boilerplate steps when building an app with its open-sourced plugins, cloud storage, and automated publishing of app to both stores. In this workshop, we will show you how to create and publish a unique production-ready application.","Thu, 31 Aug 2017 13:45:00 +0200","Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:00:00 +0200",45.0731163,13.6371103,https://github.com/shoutem/wsc2017/blob/master/assets/images/workshop.png?raw=true,day2-shoutem

Day 3 - Web of Things – Peer to Peer Web ,"The web today is a growing universe. Over the years, web technologies have evolved to give web developers the ability to create new generations of useful web experiences. One such feature is WebRTC, which provides browsers and mobile applications with Real Time Communication (RTC) capabilities via simple JavaScript APIs. In this hands-on workshop you will learn to build applications to support real time communication on the web. You will build an app to get video and take snapshots with your webcam and share them peer-to-peer via WebRTC. Along the way, you'll learn how to use the core WebRTC APIs and set up a messaging server using Node.","Fri, 01 Sep 2017 09:30:00 +0200","Fri, 01 Sep 2017 12:45:00 +0200",45.0731163,13.6371103,https://github.com/shoutem/wsc2017/blob/master/assets/images/workshop.png?raw=true,day3-webofthings

Day 3 - Building a better login with the credential management API ,"Login pages are probably the single type of page that users on the web interact with more than any other. In recent years the sign in experience has changed with the advent of federation via social networks, but whether a user has to type an email address and password or click a link and be redirected via Facebook, the process still interrupts the journey. The Credential Management API, a new W3C standard designed by Mike West at Google, is an attempt to help streamline this process at the user agent level. This workshop will investigate the new API and explore how we can use it to progressively enhance customer journeys in the apps we build.","Fri, 01 Sep 2017 13:45:00 +0200","Fri, 01 Sep 2017 17:00:00 +0200",45.0731163,13.6371103,https://github.com/shoutem/wsc2017/blob/master/assets/images/workshop.png?raw=true,day3-login
Day 3 - Knowing It All,"Rachel has been a web developer for over 20 years. Things have changed almost beyond recognition since she first sat down at a computer to figure out how to build a website.
